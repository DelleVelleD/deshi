/*
	Note on how this system is meant to work:

	Rather than dealing with objects being created/deleted in the middle of the frame and
	the consequence that might occur from that, I opted to use a creation/deletion buffer
	that only acts at the end of the frame (after rendering).

	Advantages:
	1. Objects wont get removed/inserted in the middle of the frame, possibly causing
	unexpected behaviour and affecting some systems while avoiding others.
	2. If the frame is going too long, we can opt to delay the creation or deletion of
	an entity or component, though I would say to be careful with delayed creation as players
	might notice even if the creation of something is one or two frames delayed.
	3. You can always add/remove an Entity manually into the middle of the frame through
	the EntityAdmin if necessary

	Disadvantages:
	1. More noticeable delays when on low framerates.
	2. An entity queued for deletion will still affect systems until the end of the frame.
	3. The buffer has potential to grow too large if delays keep getting stacked
