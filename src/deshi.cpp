The person listed doesn't necessarily have to be you, and can be someone else
if you feel they would handle the problem better. It should generally be you though.

Major Ungrouped TODOs
---------------------
add level saving and loading
create a hot-loadable global vars file
create a global core object rather than pass everything thru entity admin
add shaders: PBR (4textures)
settings file(s) [keybinds, video, audio, etc]
figure out why selecting sometimes selects outside of an object and sometimes doesnt select inside of an object
implement string returns, better descriptions, and parameter parsing on every command (use spawn_box as reference)

Minor Ungrouped TODOs
---------------------
add a general logging system with log levels and locations
add option to not use input callbacks so fps doesnt get affected dramatically by input
add a component_state command to print state of a component (add str methods to all components/systems)
make our own unordered_map and map that is contiguous (array of pairs basically, hash mapped keys)
add device info command (graphics card, sound device, monitor res, etc)
pool/arena components and entities for better performance
replace/remove external dependencies/includes were possible (glm, tinyobj)
add Qol (quality of life) tag to TODOP
add Camera tag to TODOP
look into integrating TODOP with Discord
add yaxis line
begin reimplementing sound system and maybe rethink its design a bit

Render TODOs
------------
add lighting and shadows
add 2D shader and interface functions
add vertex editing
fix texture transparency
add RenderSettings loading and usage
check those vulkan-tutorial links for the suggestions
avoid having 3 copies of a mesh (model, meshVK, vulkan)
add instancing
look into adding volk for faster loading/function calls
add buffer pre-allocation and arenas for vertices/indices/textures/etc
multi-threaded command buffers, shader loading, image loading
find a way to forward declare vulkan stuff and move the include to the cpp

Level Editor TODOs
------------
orbitting camera for rotating around objects
scaling objects
copy/pasting objects
typing numbers while grabbing/rotating/scaling for precise manipulation (like in Blender)
adding components
manipulating component/entity data through UI
changing materials/textures through UI
highlighing selected object (maybe AABB for now but figure out precise outlining later)
implement grabbing/rotating/scaling with a visual tool thing (like in Unreal)
world axis in top right (like we used to have)
orthographic side views
(maybe) multiple viewports
add showing axis lines through object when axis grabbing once we have lines in Vulkan
show all textures/shaders on an object instead of just the first one
keybind to move camera to object (like Blender's NPMINUS)

Physics/Atmos TODOs
-------------
finish imlementing AABB vs AABB collisions
redo main physics loop
add physics collision sweeping
add physics based collision resolution for remaining collider primitives
add physics interaction functions
implement collision manifold generation
implement Sphere vs Sphere collisions
implement Complex Colliders 

Console TODOs
-------------
fix console color parsing regex to be able to match with brackets inside
OR change how we format color to something less common than brackets
reformat to use a single character buffer rather than the line/subline thing its doing now
implement command chaining
(maybe) add auto complete for arguments of commands
add console flag for showing text in bottom right message bar like error does
command to print all avaliable keys for binding
command to print all keybinds, with (maybe) an option for printing only contextual keybinds
if multiple errors are sent to the console before the user opens it, show a number in the debug bar indicating how many

UI TODOs
--------
2D shader
add a UI popup when reloading shaders
add UI color palettes for easy color changing
renaming entities from entity list
redo debug bar to be more informative and have different modes

Math TODOs
----------
cleanup math library (remove redundant/old things, make functions more consistent, etc.)
add quaternions and converions between them and other linear algebra primitives
replace glm :)
look into scaling not rotating (scaling is probably being done in world not local)

Fun TODOs
---------
look into implementing Lua
